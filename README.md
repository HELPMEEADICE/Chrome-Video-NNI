# Chrome-Video-NNI
Play video using Nearest-neighbor interpolation in Chrome
[Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1310342)
The Chrome's video zoom algorithm like a shit
So I coding this tampermonkey script to change the zoom algorithm to Nearest-neighbor interpolation
*** You need install [Tampermonkey]([https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1310342](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)https://www.tampermonkey.net/) with your Chrome ***
This script will addon a filter in all video class(it like a Chrome bug.if you addon a filter,the video zoom algorithm will be change to the NNI)
